Medication Reminder (Medr) is a medication reminder. It will reminds people when to take certain medication.  
The main purpose of this project to learn Sturts2. 

This tool has emotional attachment also. My mother was sick for a long time and she does not have anyone to remind her to take medication. I was thinking to make a tool for her, unfortunatly she passed away before my attempt to make this tool.
