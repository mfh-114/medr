# Log book

Here, I will share my thought, reason and working tasks.

## Day 1, Feb 5, 2021.

    1. I analyzed PostgreSQL and MySQL. I was debating myself which one should I select. 
       I selected MySQL. MySQL has triggers and event scheduler. 
       
    2. Struts 2 because I want to learn Struts 2, even though it is no longer industry standard anymore. 
       In the future, if time permits, I will port this code to Spring Boot. 
       
    3. Log4J2, it is now gaining popularity, I am feeling sorry for logback.
    
    4. Last but not least JQuery.
   
I hope, I am going to jump on the coding within a few days. Happy coding.
